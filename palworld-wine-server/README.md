# Docker - Palworld Dedicated Server Wine

This is a modified version of [docker-palworld-dedicated-server](https://github.com/jammsen/docker-palworld-dedicated-server) by jammsen to use the Windows version the Palworld server instead of Linux. I've tried my best to make everything else from the previous repository work in this version, but there will probably be some incompatibilities.

## Changelog

You can find the [changelog here](CHANGELOG.md)

## Getting started

1. Create a `game` sub-directory on your Docker-Node in your game-server-directory 
   - (Examples: `/srv/palworld`, `/opt/palworld` or `/home/username/palworld`)
   - This directory will be used to store the game server files, including configs and savegames
   - In older versions we asked you to setup permissions via CHMOD or CHOWN, this should not be needed anymore!
2. Set up Port-Forwarding or NAT for the ports in the Docker-Compose file
3. Pull the latest version of the image with `docker pull jammsen/palworld-dedicated-server:latest`
4. Download the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [default.env](default.env)
5. Set up the `docker-compose.yml` and `default.env` to your liking
   - Make sure you setup PUID and PGID according to the user you want to use
     - **PUID and PGID 0 will error out, thats on purpose!**
     - if you use Docker as root, then you can just use 1000 inside the container
   - Refer to the [Environment-Variables](#environment-variables) section for more information
6. Start the container via `docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f`
   - Watch the log, if no errors occur you can close the logs with ctrl+c
7. Now have fun and happy gaming! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜‰

## Installing Mods

This Palword Windows server is capable of running the UE4SS framework to install mods.
1. Download the latest version of [UE4SS 3.0.0 or newer](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases)
2. Unzip into ./game/Pal/Binaries/Win64 (assuming that ./game/ is where /palworld from the container is bound in your host)
3. Edit UE4SS-settings.ini for the following settings:
   
   ```
   bUseUObjectArrayCache = false
   GuiConsoleEnabled = 0
   ```
5. Install mods into the Mods folder and follow the install instructions for each mod. It might require editing mods.txt or installing parts of the mod into the generated LogicMods folder.

## Environment variables

See [this file](/docs/ENV_VARS.md) for the documentation

## Docker-Compose examples

### Gameserver with RCON-CLI-Tool

See [example docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

## Run RCON commands

> [!NOTE]
> Please research the RCON-Commands on the official source: https://tech.palworldgame.com/settings-and-operation/commands

You can use `docker exec palworld-wine-server rconcli <command>` right on your terminal/shell.

```shell
$ docker exec palworld-wine-server rconcli showplayers
name,playeruid,steamid

$ docker exec palworld-wine-server rconcli info
Welcome to Pal Server[v0.1.4.1] jammsen-docker-generated-20384

$ docker exec palworld-wine-server rconcli save
Complete Save
```

## Backup Manager

> [!WARNING]
> If RCON is disabled, the backup manager won't do saves via RCON before creating a backup and will report warnings.
> This means that the backup will be created from the last auto-save of the server.
> This can lead to data-loss and/or savegame corruption.
>
> **Recommendation:** Please make sure that RCON is enabled before using the backup manager.

> [!WARNING]
> Please use in the following part always the `-user steam` option or your files will written as root


Usage: `docker exec -user steam palworld-wine-server backup [command] [arguments]`

```

```shell
$ docker exec --user steam palworld-wine-server backup list
> Listing 2 backup file(s)!
2024-02-03 03:28:55 | saved-20240203_032855.tar.gz

```

```shell
$ docker exec --user steam palworld-wine-server backup_list   
> Listing 1 out of backup 2 file(s).
2024-02-03 03:30:00 | saved-20240203_033000.tar.gz
```

## Webhook integration

To enable webhook integrations, you need to set the following environment variables in the `default.env`:

```shell
WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true
WEBHOOK_URL="https://your.webhook.url"
```

After enabling the server should send messages in a Discord-Compatible way to your webhook url.

> You can find more details about these variables [here](/docs/ENV_VARS.md#webhook-settings).

### Supported events

- Server starting 
  - This even is not server started. Just add like 5 seconds on top and the server is online
- Server stopped
- Server updating
- Server updating and validating

## Deploy with Helm

A Helm chart to deploy this container can be found at [palworld-helm](https://github.com/caleb-devops/palworld-helm).

## FAQ

### How can I use the interactive console in Portainer with this image?

> You can run this `docker exec -ti palworld-wine-server bash' or you could navigate to the **"Stacks"** tab in Portainer, select your stack, and click on the container name. Then click on the **"Exec console"** button.

### How can I look into the config of my Palworld container?

> You can run this `docker exec -ti palworld-wine-server cat /palworld/Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini` and it will show you the config inside the container.

### I'm seeing S_API errors in my logs when I start the container?

> Errors like `[S_API FAIL] Tried to access Steam interface SteamUser021 before SteamAPI_Init succeeded.` are safe to ignore.

### I'm using Apple silicon type of hardware, can I run this?

> You can try to insert in your docker-compose file this parameter `platform: linux/amd64` at the palworld service. This isn't a special fix for Apple silicon, but to run on other than x86 hosts. The support for arm exists only by enforcing x86 emulation, if that isn't to host already. Rosetta is doing the translation/emulation.

### I changed the `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` setting, why didn't this update the server?

> This is a confirmed bug. Changing `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` in the `PalWorldSettings.ini` has no effect on the server. There are tools out there to help with this, like this one: <https://github.com/legoduded/palworld-worldoptions>

> [!WARNING]
> Adding `WorldOption.sav` will break `PalWorldSetting.ini`. So any new changes to the settings (either on the file or via ENV VARS), you will have to create a new `WorldOption.sav` and update it every time for those changes to have an effect.
